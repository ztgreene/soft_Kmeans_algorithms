# soft_Kmeans_algorithms
Collection of soft K-means algorithms written in Matlab

The Data set is from eruptions of the 'Old Faithful' Geyser.

Each K-means implementation builds on the previous:
one has a fixed covariance matrix, the next has dynamic covariance and mixture coefficients,
while the last has a full Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
